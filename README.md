# Book App

**Author**: Natalie Sinner and Bhagirath Bhatt
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This week, you and your partner(s) will implement a basic full-stack application for a book list which will include the ability to search the Google Books API, add books to a database, and then render those books from a PostgreSQL database. You will also add the ability to update the details of a book or remove it from the collection.

Todayâ€™s portion of the application involves requesting books from the API. The client can submit a form to search for a book by title or author, and the search results will then be rendered as a list in the browser.

Your entire application will be deployed on Heroku.

## Getting Started
Create a new repository on GitHub named book_app. Add your partner as collaborator. Clone this repository into your 301 directory. You will be working in this same repository for labs 11 through 14.

## Architecture
- Understand how to architect a full-stack web application
- Create a schema to model data
- Interact with the Google Books API to search for books based on user queries
- Display API results to the user, hiding certain details for a smooth user experience
- Be able to dynamically render information to the user through the use of a server-side templating library

## Change Log
